# **Working With Functions!**  

## **Why Use A Function?**  
>In javaScript their are many ways to solve a problem but just because you are able to write working code it does not mean that it was the correct way to solve the problem,    
As a plumber by trade i've seen people "Fix" a plumbing issue only to cause a much grater problem to solve in the future,    
This is the same thing that you can find in the coding industry because although your solution may work if it has used badly written code you are likely to start running into many problems in the future when you attempt to add new features to a webpage or expend this is why people in the industry will use the word DRY code,  
D.R.Y stands for Don't Repeat Yourself!!  
If you don't use functions Your JavaScript is going to become very hard to manage and you will find that you will be repeating the same code over and over again as well as the fact that using functions offers you the ability to call your code whenever you want creating a much better user experience.

## **What Is A Function?**
>If you have worked with JavaScript you are likely to have already used "Functions" (If you want to play a word game technically they are called methods) but anyway my point is in JavaScript their a built in tools that are essentially pre written blocks of code that you can call and use within your code,  
So when you are writing your code you are able to use this same structure and create your own functions that you can then call upon later on and use as many times as you like if you write them correctly.
