>HTML is very similar a text document if you strip it down to it's bare bones,  
Because web-pages would be a lot less interesting if they were just a text document we have created the ability to add features that will create a better more enjoyable user experience,
Just like with other html elements we can use tags such as image, video and audio to add these extra features to a web-page and then use CSS to add even more style or JavaScript to create an additional layer of extra functionality to the web-page to create the most interactive and capturing user experience possible.
