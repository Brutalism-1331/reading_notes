# **CSS Layout**  
>When you visit a web page you simply see the completed product and unless you have knowledge of how a web page reaches your screen you likely don't know how many moving parts are behind what you see,  
Well if you strip a web page down to it's singular components you will find programing languages like HTML, javascript and CSS.  
You can have a web page without CSS but it will look very similar to a word document made with a program like Microsoft word however if you want to compete with your competition you better add some styling to your page.  

## **How Dose CSS Add Style**
>First you start by creating your HTML page and add your content after this is completed you can then start adding style to your page,  
The way CSS views the content in your HTML page is everything is a box and every box interacts with the boxes around them,  
This can take some time to get used to but once you understand how everything on a page interacts with the things around them the styling of those boxes becomes much easier.
