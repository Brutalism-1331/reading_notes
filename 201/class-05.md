# **Images And What File To Save Them As!**  

## **Overview**  
>99% of the time when creating a web-page you are likely going to use images to help convey the information that you are attempting to show people,  
If you don't take into consideration the image content and the file type you have it saved as you could greatly affect the final product,  

## **JPEG vs PNG vs GIF!**  
>If i was to list every file type this page would become very long and confusing,  
This is why i'm only going to focus on the three main image files that are the most commonly used when creating web-pages,  
Let's say you have three images,  
1. A Landscape.  
2. An Image With Structure Like A Building.   
3. An Image With Animation.  
>Do you know what image type to use in each of those situations?  
You will want to use a JPEG file when using images that don't have sharp lines because when you compress a file to make it as small as posable to save data space,  
A JPEG file will blend surrounding colors to achieve this,  
This is why JPEG is great for images that don't have ridged structure that requires sharp lines and contrast.  
If you do have an image that has structure and ridged shape that needs sharp lines your best choice of image file to use is PNG because when you compress the file to save space it achieves this without blending colors like with JPEG,  
If you want an image that changes color or has some other type of animation affects than GIF is what you want to use.
