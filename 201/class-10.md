# **JS Debugging**  

>I look at coding like I look at a plumbing job,
When you start solving a plumbing problem you first look at the problem and decide how you are going to execute your solution,  
Solving a coding problem is the same process as solving a plumbing issue only you have different tools to solve the problem,  
Because of this way of thinking before i start coding i first choose how i'm going to code the solution and lay out a blueprint that creates some type of logical structure,  
This is the first step in debugging your code because if you start with a solid plain you are going to reduce the amount of bugs in your code,  

## **Other Helpful Tips**  
>Finding ways to check for proof of life as you code will help you identify problems as they are being created,  
Use your tools like consol.log and go live regularly,  
Adding notes to your code will help you code your solution because it's always easier to code if you have some type of story that you can reference when problems arise.
