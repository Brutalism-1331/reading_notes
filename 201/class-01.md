# *What Is A Website?*  

## **Intro**
  
>Before you can start coding a website you first need to understand how a webpage is created and why it is built a specific way.

### **What is a server?**
  
>When a user opens up their choice of web browser and types in a web address the information is't stored on their PC or other devices that can access the internet,  
All the information is stored on a server now this server can be anywhere in the world but lets just keep things simple for now,  
Stored in the server are code files such as html, css and JavaScript,  
these files are than read by your browser in order to create what is shown on your screen.  

### **Coding languages**
  
>Their are different coding languages for different tasks,
The main ones used to create webpages are html, css and JavaScript this is because these are the coding languages that work on most web browsers without issues as they are the industry standard meaning things like servers and web browersers have been designed to work with this code in order to creat the best user experience possible.

#### **What is HTML**  
  
>HyperText Markup Language is the foundation of a webpage because it builds the structure that is used to hold all of the information held within the page,  
html is a relatively simple language to learn because it has a simple syntax that follows easy to understand rules and their are lots of resources online availaible to help answer any question you may have.  
I like [w3schools cheat sheet](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/default.asp)

#### **What is CSS**  
  
>Cascading Style Sheets is used to turn html from a boring looking text document into an organized and nice to look at webpage,  
It's easy to get overwhelmed with all the options available because with CSS you can make a webpage look like a 5 years old drawing that will only see the fridge door or a masterpiece that captures the imagination and attention of everyone that comes to your page,  
Just like with html their are lots of resources online to help make the process simpler,  
I like [css reference](https://cssreference.io/)

#### **What is JavaScript**  
  
>JavaScript is an object-oriented computer programming language that is commonly used to create interactive effects within a web browsers,  
It gives the programer the ability to add features to a webpage that can take and use information like a user name, show a welcome greeting that changes depending on the time of the day and so much more.

#### **Coding is alway improving**  
  
>Coding languages are always changing in order to improve sometimes this adds new features and sometimes features are removed,  
For this reason it is a programers responsibility to stay up to date with the current industry standards.
