# **JS Object Literals**  

## **The DOM**  
>Document Object Model: Is a cross-platform interface that treats an HTML document as a tree structure wherein each node is an object representing a part of the document. The DOM represents a document with a logical tree.  

## **Object Literals**  
>JavaScript object literals are a comma-separated list of name-value pairs wrapped in curly braces.  
Object literals store data,  
Unlike when using an array you use the assigned value name instead of an index number,  

With the combination of the DOM you are able to create content on a HTML page all within your javascript.  

## **Summary**  
>object literals are a great way to create objects that hold data that can then be used within your code and even printed on your html page with the use of the DOM.
