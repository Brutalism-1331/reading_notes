# **Building Blocks**  

## **html**  
>Because html is used to give structure to a web-page it has many elements that are used to create this structure, 
In the past the structure of the page was commonly created by using the `<div>` tag,  
Although this tag can be used in many situations it is no longer the best option as html5 has given us new tags to play with like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<ul>` and `<ol>`,  
The last two tags mentioned `<ul>`/`<ol>` for instance are used to create unordered and ordered lists.

## **CSS**
>Css is used to give form to the structure,  
If you imagine a new home that is being built the html is being used to tell you what is inside of the home and css is used to place all of the things inside of the home in there desired locations,  
Another helpful way to think of css is to imagine that every element created in the html file is it's own box that must have a place on the screen,  
Css allows you to identify a box and it's content so that you can give it conditions that is must adhere too.  

## **JavaScript**
>If we use a finished house as an example this time javascript is like a light switch, A tap or essentially anything that takes in input from a source human or machine and creates a desired output or response,   
In javascript we have a useful tool called an array,  
I believe a helpful way to imagine an array is to picture an electrical fuse box,  
A fuse box has a main power supply that than is able to distribute that power to other fuses,  
An array is able to store data and then have that data referenced when required,  
You are then able to use conditional statements or comparison operators to evaluate the data held within the array so that you can get a desired function added to the web page.
