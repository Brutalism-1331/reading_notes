# **How is a website built!**

>In my last reading notes we learned about what a website is and gave a little bit of information about each of the different coding languages,  
In this reading notes we are going to take a closer look at each of them and talk about how they are used together in order to create a good user experience.  

## **HTML**  
#### _(HyperText Markup Language)_  

>This is the foundation of any web page,  
When coding in html it can feel like writing a word document with a few extra steps or rules to remember,    
This is because a html document is where all of the text information of a website is compiled.  

>One thing to remember is unlike when you use your favourite text editor html requires you to tell it what the information is and how to display it on the screen,  
I could list all the different TAGS but i like to use [w3schools page for quick reference](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/default.asp).

## **CSS**  
#### _(Cascading Style Sheets)_

>You could create a webpage only using html however that would be like trying to sell ice cream out of an old run down van,  
sure you may sell a few ice creams on a hot day but most of the time people will not trust you even if you have good ice cream,  
This is why we add CSS to a web page,  
This can be done a number of different ways however the most common way is to create a different file usually labeled styles.css,  
In this file you will now be coding in css not html however css uses the tags and other elements in the html file to give it a point of reference so that it knows what todo,  
Their are many different rules to learn, Like when choosing a selector which will take precedence over another.  
I find [css_reference](https://cssreference.io/) a good starting point if i need information on how todo something new,

## **JavaScript**  

>Javascript is used to bring your webpage to life,  
Maybe you will include some code that welcomes the user based on the time of the day or maybe you will prompt the user to input their name so that you can create a more personal experience.  
The list go's on as to what you can do with JavaScript but the formula to create these results relies on a few key components that defines the JavaScript language,  
These are things like variables, prompts, if/elseif statements, while loops and so on,  
As well as the use of assignment operators and logical operators,  
Theses elements are than used to build the structure of your JavaScript function and can do many different things like checking to make sure that you got the correct response, Only giving a set number of wrong password attempts before locking you out of your account and so on.

#### Summary  
>You don't need to be a master of all of these different coding languages to be successful in a coding career,   However you must learn the basics of all of them because even if you are only required to code in one of the languages within the team of people that are building a website,  
You will need to understand how each of the languages are uses together in order to create a finished result that works well.
