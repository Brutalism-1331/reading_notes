# **Object-Oriented Programming**  

## **Why Use Object-Oriented Programming**
>Coding is all about creating efficient solutions to real world problems,  
Because of this when we write our code we are attempting to write it in a way that is as simple as posable or "DRY" for a number of reasons such as load speeds to create a better user experience,  
When looking at the programing side of things the advantage of creating "DRY" code is it's easier to read and understand what the code is doing as well as making the code easier to keep it updated as new technology is released or if the the coding solution is needed to be expanded to a larger scope.  

## **What Is Object-Oriented Programming**  
>Object-Oriented Programming is a type of programing style where you use many of the same tools however the way that you use them is a little different because you write code that creates objects that will contain the data that you would usually have written within your functions.  
This means if you can write the code once and than reuse the same code an infinite numberer of times.
