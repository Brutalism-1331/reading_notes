# Computer Architecture and Logic

>In todays world computers come in many shapes and sizes and are found on a desk, in a backpack, in your pocket and even on your wrist.

Although they may all look different they all use a similar list of components eg, cpu, storage drive, a screen but each component is chosen for its application because not all computers are required todo the same thing,

Binary code is made up of lots of 1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1 that act like a light switch turning on or off creating yes/no or true/false statements,

Unlike a living creature that has a brain that is able to make decisions based upon the information it sees a computer isâ€™t able to function without being given every bit of information and tolded what todo with the information it receives,

Basically even the most complicated task or question you ask a computer will be broken down into a simple yes or no, true or false process that can be completed in the blink of an eye.
