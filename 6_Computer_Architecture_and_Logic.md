# Computer Architecture and Logic


>In todays world computers come in many shapes and sizes and are found on a desk, in a backpack, in your pocket and even on your wrist.


Although they may all look different they all use a similar list of components eg, cpu, storage drive, a screen but each component is chosen for its application because not all computers are required todo the same thing,


Binary code is made up of lots of 1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1 that act like a light switch turning on or off creating yes/no or true/false statements,


Unlike a living creature that has a brain that is able to make decisions based upon the information it sees a computer isn’t able to function without being given every bit of information and tolded what todo with the information it receives,


Basically even the most complicated task or question you ask a computer will be broken down into a simple yes or no, true or false process that can be completed in the blink of an eye.


## Input
>when you enter a command with your keyboard, touch the screen of a smart phone or anything else that involves you the user giving a command to a computer,
Their is so much happening behind the screen that you are unlikely even aware of unless you have an interest in learning about this type of thing,


## Output
>After you give your instruction to the computer it's going to run that command through the programming structure it has been told to use during this scenario,
As long as their isn't anything wrong with how your input is registered and run through your computers brain (CPU) this is what your computers brain is usually called in the tec world it will go through the process of true or false statements that create the binary code mentioned above,
this binary code will then tell the program that is running the command what the output should be,


## Computer advancements
>To put things into perspective of just how far the technology behind what is displayed on your screen has come,
when the world was racing to get the first person onto the moon the size of the computer required to process a few lines of commands took up almost two full rooms,
skip forward a few years into 2021 almost everyone above the age of 18 carries in their pocket a phone that is capable of doing much more than the computer that NASSA used to put a man on the moon.
