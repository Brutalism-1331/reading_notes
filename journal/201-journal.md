>I read the recommended page regarding learning,

 i will read things more in depth  in the future but with this one i believe i have developed a way of learning that works for me so i find it difficult to want to put much effort into seeing learning from a different perspective as i feel the above article is written for someone who may not have challenged themselves to learn new things as i have,   

It has taken me a long time to learn how to learn,

But i believe the first decision that i made that has helped me become a master at learning new things was my decision to become a plumber at the age of 15,

Because of the type of plumbing work that i did i have learned to be very good a problem solving complex issues in a fast paced,

no failure aloud environment,

Outside of work i've also done many things, i've played bass guitar in a metal band, ridden sports motorcycles at high speeds that would kill you if you crashed, traveled to the other side of the world and built a new life for myself,

Currently i'm learning to play the drums, learning to play bass guitar and make electronic music as well as converting a school bus into a mobile tiny home/ large art project and completing my tattooed body suit,

The reason i'm taking this course is because i was injured at work due to another worker not doing their job correctly,

My plain was and still is to become a tattoo artist however in order for me to reach that goal i need to be able to make money to complete some of my current projects first and thats why i've taken this opportunity to learn how to code,  

My list could go on about the character i have built that has required me to learn how to be self-aware and hold myself accountable when making decisions but the point i'm making is i've learned a system that works for me of how to be in a child like mindset that allows me to learn in a playful way yet still achieve at a high level,

I believe the main thing that i need todo is trust in myself and my abilities as they have proven to always lead to success throughout my life, 

If i do this and remain calm when i can't find the answer i'll be able to find a solution to any of my issues from using tools like google, looking at old projects or asking questions and getting one on one help.

The KEY to learning is to understand that you will never know everything,

So it is better to take every new opportunity to learn when you can,

Then to think you know everything and miss out on a learning a new possibly valuable lesson.
