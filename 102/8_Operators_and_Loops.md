# Operators and Loops

>in this class we started learning about when and how to use a javascript loop in order to create a better user experience when using our created 
website or to add security measures when requiring things like a password,

what is a for loop,  
In computer science, a for-loop (or simply for loop) is a control flow statement for specifying iteration, which allows code to be executed repeatedly. ... For-loops are typically used when the number of iterations is known before entering the loop. 


>You would likely use a for loop when requesting input of a password or any other situation where you only want a maximum number of iterations before moving onto the next block of your  your code,
If you have ever entered your password wrong (X) number of times and been given an alert that your account has been locked or you need to reset your password,
This was likely a for loop in action and you didn't even know it!

What is a while loop,
in most computer programming languages, a while loop is a control flow statement that allows code to be executed repeatedly based on a given Boolean condition.


>You would likely use a while loop when you require a specific answer,
this could be a "string" or if "input" is returned   (empty) you will give the user a new prompt to enter the data that you have requested of them,  


>The difference between a for and while loop is that a while loop will not end until it receives the answer needed to exist the while loop,  


loops require you to write your code with logic however don't forget that you must get a return of false in order  to end the loop so pay attention to the parameters that you use within your code because if you get a true return your going to remain stuck in the while loop even if you get the answer that you are looking for.
