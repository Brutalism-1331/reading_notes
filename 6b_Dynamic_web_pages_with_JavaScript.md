# Dynamic web pages with JavaScript

>In this class we started learning about javascript and how it can be used to make a website interactive for the user and also be used to gather information that can than be used to display on screen showing things like their name followed by a greeting or the cost of an order,

Without javascript a webpage is a lot less welcoming,
I look forward to learning as much as I can about javascript and all of itâ€™s functions in the future
