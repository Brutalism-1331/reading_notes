# Dynamic web pages with JavaScript

>In this class we started learning about javascript and how it can be used to make a website interactive for the user and also be used to gather information that can than be used to display on screen showing things like their name followed by a greeting or the cost of an order,

Without javascript a webpage is a lot less welcoming,
I look forward to learning as much as I can about javascript and all of itâ€™s functions in the future,

>Although i'm a little overwhelmed with what if statements, functions, loops and the rest of commands you can run through JavarScript i like the fact that it's commands are based in logic because once i understand where and why to use syntax commands like =, ==, !==, {},(),&& and so on i believe i will enjoy being able to add life to my HTML and CSS code in order to create fun and interactive webpages that people will enjoy coming back too because this is going to keep people wanting to use my services over someone else who just does this for a job to get paid.
