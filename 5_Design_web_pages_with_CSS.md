#Design web pages with CSS

Class started to be a lot more fun once we started learning CSS because it started to show us why we start with HTML and structure a web page the way we do,  
I liked CSS because i'm an artist so i feel CSS and eventually Javascript will be a new ways that i can make money creating web pages for others and eventually start some projects of my own.

## css is a powerful coding language

The list of things that you can do with css is endless because unlike with HTML that only creates a simple document style webpage css lets your creativity run free,  
You can keep things simple by just adding a plain background colour with your choice of font or you can add id tags in your HTML and then call those tags in your styles.css file giving you the ability to set parameters on every element that is shown on your page,

I think lots of people get overwhelmed with the amount of options available when using css like when you are given a blank sheet of paper and a box of pens but if you have a creative eye the   potential job opportunities are endless because you can have the best written code in the world but if it doesn't look nice people will use another page even if it doesn't have as good of features,
