# Design web pages with CSS

>Class started to be a lot more fun once we started learning CSS because it started to show us why we start with HTML and structure a web page the way we do,  
I liked CSS because i'm an artist so i feel CSS and eventulay Javarscript will be a new ways that i can make money creating web pages for others and eventually start some projects of my own.
