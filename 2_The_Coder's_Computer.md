# The Coder's Computer
>this was a long process that didn't go smoothly because we were thrown into the deep end and told to swim,
Although it would have been nice for everything to have gone a lot smoother many lessons were learned along the way,
It was very rewarding to be able to help other people with issues once I learned how to nav the terminal better.

>I could not have done this without brad because he was able to help resolve an issue with my terminal not saving installed commands or file locations,  
I look forward to learning more of this stuff in the future because i can see how important it is to not only be able to use your computer but to understand how it works and why we do thing in a particular way,
as a bonus i believe learning more will also help me make music with my MacBook.
