# The Coder's Computer
>this was a long process that didn't go smoothly because we were thrown into the deep end and told to swim,
Although it would have been nice for everything to have gone a lot smoother many lessons were learned along the way,
It was very rewarding to be able to help other people with issues once I learned how to nav the terminal better.

>I could not have done this without brad because he was able to help resolve an issue with my terminal not saving installed commands or file locations,  
I look forward to learning more of this stuff in the future because i can see how important it is to not only be able to use your computer but to understand how it works and why we do thing in a particular way,
as a bonus i believe learning more will also help me make music with my MacBook. 

## Choosing a text editor!  
Their are many different text editors available depending on the type of code that you are using,
If you wanted to keep things simple your computer already has programs that you could use like note pad or text edit on Mac,
Just stay away from programs like Microsoft word because it has its own style of processing input so you will likely not get the desired result,

>I chose VS studio code because it is a very powerful text editor that helps simplify the process of writing and lunching your code on sites like GitHub,


### Terminal cheat sheet

>I have found navigating terminal easy and fun how ever I sill have a lot to learn in relation to installing files and other more complicated programming tasks,

The key commands Iâ€™ve learned are CD-change directory, git status to see if my working tree is up to date, git clone to get a repo off go git hub on to my laptops working environment so that I can work from any where, git (ACP)- git add - git commit - git push origin main and my favourite code . because this opens VS studio and makes me feel like a cool hacker guy.
