## Structure web pages with HTML
> I enjoyed finding out that we were going to be using HTML because i had already been learning by reading about how to use HTML in Jon Duckett's HTML & CSS book.

>I prefer using HTML because once you learn how to use (tags) and other syntax to strutures a page creating a web page becomes very easy and enjoyable,

>HTML is a good language to learn because the entier web is built using it and is then made to look good by adding css and java script.
