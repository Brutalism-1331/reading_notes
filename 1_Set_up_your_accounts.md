## Day 1

>On day one after setting up and logging into all of our accounts we created our first repo on GitHub.

**When creating a GitHub Repo you must add a README.md page!**

>I beleive markdown is a very simple language to learn as it follows a simplified *HTML* structure with diffrent syntax used.  
I don't see myself using MarkDown often but i'm confident if i'm asked to create a MarkDown page i will be able to complete it in a reasonable time frame and anything i don't know i'll be able to find on **google**
