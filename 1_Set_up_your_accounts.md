# Day 1

>On day one after setting up and logging into all of our accounts we created our first repo on GitHub.

**When creating a GitHub Repo you must add a README.md page!**

>I beleive markdown is a very simple language to learn as it follows a simplified *HTML* structure with diffrent syntax used.  
I don't see myself using MarkDown often but i'm confident if i'm asked to create a MarkDown page i will be able to complete it in a reasonable time frame and anything i don't know i'll be able to find on **google**  

## Groth Mindset

>I see the world differently to most due to the path in life I have lived,
Starting a plumbing apprenticeship at 16 wasn’t an easy path to go down but  learning to master one craft has allowed me to move to the other side of the world and still be able to find success because the most valuable lesson i’ve learned working as a plumber for close to 15 years is that plumbing is just problem solving and the only difference between plumbing and life is plumbing has a specific way of solving problems  but the process and critical thinking can translate to any other problem I face because their is always a solution you just need to find it.
